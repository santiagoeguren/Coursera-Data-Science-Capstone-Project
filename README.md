# Coursera-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

The application is the  project for the Coursera Data Science specialization, made for professors of the Johns Hopkins University and SwiftKey. 


-The main goal of this project is to make a  application that is able to predict the next word.

##Data Analysis and Manipulation

After creating the Corpus, the analysis concluded that a data cleaning is necessary for an accurate prediction algorithm to work with a successful.


The sample dataset was transformed by eliminating  Whitespace, removal of numbers, punctuation, profanity and converting the text to lower case. The processing functions  are used essentially the “tm” libraries.

The resulting data are used to predict the next word in connection with the text input by a user.

##The App

The user interface of the application was designed to predict English words. The App has an  interface that refreshes the predicted word as text is being enterd.

To use the application,  type in a word, phrase. The app will show the next top predicted word. The user can enter additional words, or change their entry, and the app will respond to the new input.
